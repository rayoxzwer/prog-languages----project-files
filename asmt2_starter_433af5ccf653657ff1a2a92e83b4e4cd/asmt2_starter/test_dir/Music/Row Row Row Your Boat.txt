Row, row, row your boat
Gently down the stream,
Merrily merrily, merrily, merrily
Life is but a dream

Row, row, row your boat
Gently down the brook,
If you catch a little fish
Please let it off the hook

Row, row, row your boat
Gently down the creek,
If you see a little mouse
Listen to it squeak

Row, row, row your boat
Gently down the river,
If the river gets you wet
Don't forget to shiver

Row, row, row the boat
Gently to the shore,
If you see a lyin' bear
Don't forget to roar

Row, row, row your boat
Watch the water flow,
Rowing's fun but rowing's hard
That is what I know

Row, row, row your boat
Gently down the lake,
Don't stand up and rock the boat
That's a big mistake!

Row, row, row your boat
See the water run,
Rowing here and rowing there
Oh we're almost done

Row, row, row your boat
Gently down the stream,
Ha ha fooled ya all
I'm a submarine

Row, row, row your boat
Gently down the stream,
Merrily merrily, merrily, merrily
Life is but a dream
